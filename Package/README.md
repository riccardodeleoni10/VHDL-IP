A custum package used to simplify and speed up designing in VHDL.
At the present day the package can:
- Evaluate floor(log2) to easy compute the bit range of std_logic_vector to address memory locations
- A fast function make arithmetic right shifting
- A custum memory type to fast instanciate ROMs and RAMs
- Fast 2 input mux 
- Fast function to sum two unsigned numbers
